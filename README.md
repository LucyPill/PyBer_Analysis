# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge is to help PyBer a Python based ride sharing app to analyze a large set of data. The analysis we produce will help the CEO making decisions on improving access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

To aim ourselves on this analysis, we will write python script using pandas library, Jupyter notebook, and matplotlib to create charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the numbers of drivers and riders by type of cities as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of cities. 

# Results:
### The urban cities have:
* 2.7X more rides than the suburban cities and 13X more rides than the rural cities

* 5X more drivers than the suburban cities and 30X more drivers than the rural cities

* 2X more fares than the suburban cities and 9X more fares than the rural cities

While urban cities have the highest number of total rides, drivers, and fares, when it comes to average fare per ride and average fare per driver it has the lowest. This makes sense since urban cities are more populated than rural and suburban, and more people use ride sharing services than in the rural and suburban cities. There are more drivers in the suburban cities making it more competitive and more favorable for lower prices. Where the demand of drivers is low like rural cities the fare per ride will increase and this is exactly what we see in the DataFrame below.
